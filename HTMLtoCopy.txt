<div class="info">We are a group of economists at Stanford, UC Berkeley and Univ. of Chicago working on an economic model to understand the economic and health implications of different ways to reopen the economy during the ongoing crisis. Our model allows a policy-maker to take a variety of policy actions (say, shut down an industry, shut down a single location, change the days on which people work etc) and understand the implications for both the economy and health outcomes. We are able to provide results on the effects of reopening policies specific to a given metro area (e.g. Bay area, New York) since we rely on granular data on social and economic networks at the city-level for our analysis. 

We are looking for someone to help us design an interactive web interface for our model. Given our geographic focus, the interface should have a heavy mapping component, where a visitor can click on certain regions or places that he/she would like to "shut down" and examine the implications of that decision on health/economic outcomes. We will work with you to design a simple MVP and then refine and improve it over time. The ultimate goal is to diffuse the results of our analysis to the general public, business owners and policy-makers to enable them to make the best decisions about reopening the economy in the weeks and months ahead.</div>
